# Macfile: like Dockerfile but for your new mac.

A simple repo to provide functionality for configuring a new mac for development.

## tl;dr 
**Warning:** if you are not the creator of this script, you should probably read through what is being installed. 

1. Fill in github user, email, and org in macfile.sh
2. Ensure zsh is already installed (default shell on MacOS 12)
3. Check to see if anything has been installed already.
4. run `./macfile.sh`
   - obviously, this needs to be executable.

# TODO:
I will probably not get all of these, but it's a list of config I'll need to do anyways.
- zshrc plugins
- "open with vs code" macos automator
- 24 hour clock with seconds
- have application X always open file Y
- open terminal from folder
- set default browser
- brave browser settings:
    - disable built in password management
    - 1password plugin
    - import bookmarks
- cat:
    - zshrc
- copy: 
    - vimrc
    - ssh config
